                    <p><em>by William Shakespeare</em></p>
                        
                    <p>
                        Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
                        <br>Thou art more <em>lovely</em> and more <strong>temperate</strong>:
                        <br>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
                        <br>And summer's lease hath all too short a <sup>date</sup>.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
                        <br>And often his gold complexion <sub>dimm'ds</sub>,
                        <br>And every fair from fair sometime declines,
                        <br>By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
                        <br>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
                        <br>Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
                        <br>When in eternal line to time thou grow'st,
                        <br>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
                        <br>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
                    </p>
